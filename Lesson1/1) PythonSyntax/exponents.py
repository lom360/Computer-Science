# Python can also perform exponentiation. 
# In written math, you might see an exponent as a superscript number, 
# but typing superscript numbers isn't always easy on modern keyboards. 
# Since this operation is so related to multiplication, we use the notation **.

# 2 to the 10th power, or 1024
print(2 ** 10)

# 8 squared, or 64
print(8 ** 2)

# 9 * 9 * 9, 9 cubed, or 729
print(9 ** 3)

# We can even perform fractional exponents
# 4 to the half power, or 2
print(4 ** 0.5)

# Problem 1
# Using the exponent operator, print out how many squares 
# you'll need for a 6x6 quilt, a 7x7 quilt, and an 8x8 quilt.

# Calculation of squares for:
# 6x6 quilt
print(6 ** 2)
# 7x7 quilt
print(7 ** 2)
# 8x8 quilt
print(8 ** 2)

# Your 6x6 quilts have taken off so well, 6 people have each requested 6 quilts. 
# Print out how many tiles you would need to make 6 quilts apiece for 6 people.
# How many squares for 6 people to have 6 quilts each that are 6x6?
print(6 ** 4)
